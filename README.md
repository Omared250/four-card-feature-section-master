### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

### Design

You all can find the preview of the page in the Design folder, where you can guide yourself about how you want that your page looks like.

- Live Site URL: https://four-card-feature-section-master-kappa-kohl.vercel.app/

## My process

My first step was to build the project base by creating the folder that stores the css style, the folder that stores the images and create the html file. After this, 
I proceeded to create a local git repository to save the versions of my project. I link it with a remote github repository to be able to update my project on the web 
and then I started to configure my project at the html and css level.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I think that the part that I most enjoyed doing because it was the one that made me think the most and I don't know if the solution I have given is the most 
appropriate, but I like the part of making a page responsive a lot and I think I've learned to use more or to better recognize the break points and use them to 
improve my project. although i think i use too many @media hahaha
